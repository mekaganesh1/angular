So AngularJS or Angular?
Wondering about version that will be the best for you? The newer version of Angular is a popular solution. Moreover, mostly it will be a better choice. Anyway, before you choose one of them to your new project, try to answer some questions:

What libraries would you like to use?

Are they compatible with Angular?

What web browsers we want to support? (this one is really important)

If you choose only new browsers, then Angular is the best. It’s because it is a forward-looking library, but don’t forget about other browsers. For example: IE8 for which you should definitely use AngularJS from version 1.3 that supports IE8 and higher.
